/// Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file

/// storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add
/// and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they
/// need it. For more information, see the
/// [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html).

  /// Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token
  /// in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling
  /// the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system
  /// does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's AWS account with
  /// the specified creation token, this operation does the following:
  ///
  /// *   Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon
  /// EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state `creating`.
  ///
  /// *   Returns with the description of the created file system.
  ///
  ///
  /// Otherwise, this operation returns a `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error with
  /// the ID of the existing file system.
  ///
  ///  For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the
  /// creation token.
  ///
  ///  The idempotent operation allows you to retry a `CreateFileSystem` call
  /// without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an
  /// initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file
  /// system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level
  /// timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same
  /// creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file
  /// system, the client can learn of its existence from the
  /// `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error.
  ///
  ///  The `CreateFileSystem` call returns while the file system's lifecycle
  /// state is still `creating`. You can check the file system creation status
  /// by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things
  /// returns the file system state.
  ///
  /// This operation also takes an optional `PerformanceMode` parameter that you
  /// choose for your file system. We recommend `generalPurpose` performance
  /// mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO` performance
  /// mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per
  /// second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file
  /// operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system
  /// has been created. For more information, see
  /// [Amazon EFS: Performance Modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html).
  ///
  /// After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle
  /// state to `available`, at which point you can create one or more mount
  /// targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see
  /// CreateMountTarget. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2

  /// In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are

  /// *   VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
  ///
  /// *   Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
  ///
  /// *   IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the
  /// mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)
  ///
  ///
  /// After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that
  /// includes, a `MountTargetId` and an `IpAddress`. You use this IP address
  /// when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the
  /// mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on

  /// mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see
  /// [How it Works: Implementation Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation).
  ///
  /// Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC,
  /// and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if
  /// the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the
  /// subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the

  ///
  /// *   Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount
  /// targets
  ///
  /// *   Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the
  /// existing mount targets
  ///
  ///
  /// If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:
  ///
  /// *   Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
  ///
  /// *   Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:
  ///
  ///     *   If the request provides an `IpAddress`, Amazon EFS assigns that IP
  /// address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free
  /// address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2
  /// `CreateNetworkInterface` call does when a request does not specify a
  /// primary private IP address).
  ///
  ///     *   If the request provides `SecurityGroups`, this network interface
  /// is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the
  /// default security group for the subnet's VPC.
  ///
  ///     *   Assigns the description `Mount target _fsmt-id_ for file system
  /// _fs-id_`  where  `_fsmt-id_`  is the mount target ID, and  `_fs-id_`  is
  /// the `FileSystemId`.
  ///
  ///     *   Sets the `requesterManaged` property of the network interface to
  /// `true`, and the `requesterId` value to `EFS`.
  ///
  ///
  ///     Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed
  /// EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS
  /// sets the `NetworkInterfaceId` field in the mount target's description to
  /// the network interface ID, and the `IpAddress` field to its address. If
  /// network interface creation fails, the entire `CreateMountTarget` operation
  /// fails.
  ///
  ///
  ///  The `CreateMountTarget` call returns only after creating the network
  /// interface, but while the mount target state is still `creating`, you can
  /// check the mount target creation status by calling the DescribeMountTargets
  /// operation, which among other things returns the mount target state.
  ///
  /// We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability
  /// Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an
  /// Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability
  /// Zone. For more information, see [Amazon EFS](http://aws.amazon.com/efs/).
  /// In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance's
