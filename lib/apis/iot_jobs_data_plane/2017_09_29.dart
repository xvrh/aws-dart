/// AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote
/// operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices connected to
/// AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices
/// to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate
/// certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations.
///
///  To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the
/// remote operations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets that
/// should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing
/// groups or both.
///
///  AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available.
/// The target starts the execution of the job by downloading the job document,
/// performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS
/// IoT. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a
/// specific target and for all the targets of the job
